# Detecting Undervaluation and Overvaluation of Imported Goods

## Author: Paul Sentongo

---

### Project Overview
This project aims to identify undervaluation and overvaluation of imported goods by predicting the unit price of commodities in local currency. This effort supports fair trade practices, ensures accurate taxation, and contributes to regulatory compliance. The solution involves multiple stages, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model development, evaluation, and deployment.

### Key Steps

#### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
- Load the dataset and examine its structure.
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- Handle missing values and detect/remove outliers.

#### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Perform descriptive statistics to understand data distribution.
- Visualize data to uncover patterns and relationships.

#### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Create new features to improve predictive performance.
- Normalize or scale features when required.

#### 4. **Model Building**
- Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for the problem.
- Train and validate models using cross-validation techniques.

#### 5. **Model Evaluation**
- Assess model performance using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
- Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

#### 6. **Model Deployment**
- Prepare the final model for deployment.
- Deploy the model using platforms such as Streamlit or Flask for web-based interaction.

#### 7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
- Continuously monitor model performance in production.
- Update the model as new data and feedback become available.
